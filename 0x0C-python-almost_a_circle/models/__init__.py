"""The __init__.py file is used to indicate that the directory
it is in should be treated as a Python package.
This file is typically empty, but it can be used to perform initialization
tasks for the package, such as setting variables or defining submodules.
This file is required for the package to be importable.
And it is used by the import system to find and load the package when it is imported
